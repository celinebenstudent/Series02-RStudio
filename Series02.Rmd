# Correlations and linear regression
In this series of exercises, you will explore correlations and linear regression, using a dataset from a real experiment.

## The problem
You want to know if there is a relationship between the nonuse of the proximal part of the upper limb (PANU) and the nonuse of the shoulder (SANU) or the elbow (EENU).

## The data
As you will see, the data is far from perfect, but this is the reality of experimental data, especially in the case of clinical data.

Download the file NonUse.csv from the course Moodle.

This file contains measures of upper extremity nonuse:


PANU: Proximal Arm Non Use
SANU: Shoulder Antepulsion Non Use
EENU: Elbow Extension Non Use

In your notebook, make a clear description of the experiment, the variables and the data. Do not forget to give the units of each variable, and the range of possible values.

## Corelation analysis
Below are some questions to guide your analysis.

Is PANU correlated with SANU and/or EENU?

Visualize the PANU-SANU relationship (and the PANU-EENU relationship)

Perform a linear regression for PANU-SANU (and for PANU-EENU)

Give the regression equations: PANU = a * SANU + b and PANU = a * EENU + b

Summarize your results as you would do in your master’s thesis report, or as in a scientific article (e.g., What sentence will you write in the article explaining your result?).

What are the limits of your analysis?

# Statistical tests: comparison of medians (or means?)
In this series of exercises, you will explore how to compare two groups of data, using non-parametric tests (or parametric tests… if it makes sense to do so).

## Make clear what is a statistical test, and when to use it.
Below are some questions to guide your analysis. You can answer them in your notebook, with a short sentence for each question.


What is a median? A mean?

    Median: the middle value of ordered data (50% above, 50% below).
    Mean: the arithmetic average of all values.
     Ref: [Moore et al., Introduction to the Practice of Statistics, 2017]

What is a variance? A standard deviation?

    Variance (σ²): average squared deviation from the mean.
    Standard deviation (σ): square root of variance, shows average spread in original units.
    Ref: [Freedman et al., Statistics, 2007]

What is a normal distribution?

    A symmetric, bell-shaped distribution defined by mean μ and variance σ².
    Ref: [Casella & Berger, Statistical Inference, 2002]

What is a statistical test?

    A procedure to decide if observed data provide enough evidence against a null hypothesis.
    Ref: [Fisher, Statistical Methods for Research Workers, 1925]

When to use a statistical test?

    When you want to infer about a population parameter from sample data (e.g., mean difference, correlation).
    Ref: [Altman, Practical Statistics for Medical Research, 1990]

What is a parametric test? A non-parametric test?

    Parametric: assumes data follow a known distribution (e.g., t-test, ANOVA).
    Non-parametric: no distributional assumption, works with ranks (e.g., Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon).
    Ref: [Conover, Practical Nonparametric Statistics, 1999]

What are the assumptions of parametric tests?

    Normal distribution (or large n, CLT).
    
    Homogeneity of variance (equal spread between groups).
    
    Independence of observations.
    Ref: [Field, Discovering Statistics Using R, 2012]

What are the assumptions of non-parametric tests?

    Independence of observations.

    Ordinal or continuous data.

    Similar shapes of distributions if comparing medians.
    Ref: [Conover, 1999]

What is a p-value?

    The probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
    Ref: [Wasserstein & Lazar, The ASA Statement on p-Values, 2016]
    
What is the risk of error when using a statistical test?

    Type I error (α): rejecting a true null hypothesis (false positive).
    Type II error (β): failing to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative).
    Ref: [Neyman & Pearson, 1933]

What is the difference between a paired and an unpaired test?

    Paired: compares repeated measures on the same subjects (e.g., before vs after).
    Unpaired: compares independent groups (e.g., treatment vs control).
    Ref: [Altman, 1990]


You can use your favorite LLM, book or web site to answer these questions, but you have to provide at least one reference for each answer (book, article, URL, LLM prompt, etc.).

    Prompt used on CHatGPT-5 plus : "Can you answer these questions in a direct and concise way, if possible by providing references to each question ?"
    

## Effect of treatment over time
This is a very classical question in clinical or sport research: does a treatment-training have an effect over time?

To answer this question scientifically, measurements must be taken before and after treatment, and possibly later, in order to assess whether the effect is lasting or not.

## The data
Download the file PrePost.csv

This file contains before/after measurements. The treatment is a rehabilitation training for individuals with cardiac conditions.

Before going further, you have to make clear what are the measured variables. What do they measure? What are the units? What are the possible values? What are the expected changes over rehabilitation.

Make a table, with one row per variable, and the following columns:

| Variable | Description | Unit | Possible values | Expected change |

## The analysis
You want to know if the treatment has an effect on one or more of the measured variables.

Does the treatment have an effect?

What comparison are you going to make?

Which test will you use? Parametric or non-parametric?

Which graph illustrates the effect of the treatment?

What sentence will you write in your thesis to explain your result?

# Testing some stereotypes
Humans have stereotypes, some of them are probably true, some others are probably false (e.g., ref ).

Here, we will test stereotypes about snorers… among others.

## The data
Download the file snore.txt

This file contains anthropometric and qualitative measurements (1 person per line).

## The analysis
Do the data confirm the following stereotypes? Provide a reasoned answer (data, figure, result sentence) for each question.
Are snorers fatter?
Do snorers drink or smoke more?
Are men fatter?
Do women smoke less?
From a more general perspective:
Are there any correlations between variables?

## Epilogue: beyond the scope of this series
Finally, some of you may want to go beyond the scope of this series with new questions, such as:

Can you predict the value of one variable from the others? (linear regression, logistic regression, etc.)
Can you classify individuals based on their variables? (clustering, PCA, etc.)
NOTE: These questions are more advanced, and I don’t want you to address them from a technical standpoint or provide code. But they give you an idea of what you can do with data mining techniques… provided you know why you want to do it. I invite you to think about the perspective these questions open up and, if you feel ready to do so, to write a short paragraph about it.
